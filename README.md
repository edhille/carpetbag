carpetbag
=========

Bash scripts to help me set up basic development plumbing on any nix machine. I borrowed heavily from [nomad](https://github.com/nijotz/nomad).

Assumptions:

* the scripts all assume they are running in `~/.carpetbag`
* make sure all your install script have execute permissions
